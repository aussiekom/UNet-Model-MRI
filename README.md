# UNet model for brain MRI segmentation
## Description

The code provided is a Python implementation of a brain segmentation model using the UNet architecture. The model is trained on brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data to segment FLAIR abnormality regions. The dataset consists of brain MRI volumes and corresponding segmentation masks.

## Code Structure

The process is organized into several sections:

* Importing Dependencies: The required libraries and modules are imported, including PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, and skimage.
* Data Preprocessing: Several functions are defined to preprocess the brain MRI data. These functions include cropping the volumes, padding them to a square shape, resizing them to a specific size, and normalizing the intensity values.
* Dataset Class: The BrainSegmentationDataset class is implemented as a PyTorch Dataset subclass. It loads and preprocesses the brain MRI data, performs data augmentation if specified, and provides access to individual samples.
* Data Transformations: The transforms function and three transformation classes (Scale, Rotate, HorizontalFlip) are defined to apply various transformations to the input samples.
* UNet Model: The UNet class represents the UNet architecture for brain segmentation. It consists of encoder and decoder blocks, with skip connections for feature concatenation. The forward pass of the model applies the necessary operations for encoding, decoding, and final convolution.
